        <blockquote>
          <p>Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and choice, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason, the good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 3</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>For before now men have been undone by reason of their wealth, and others by reason of their courage</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 4</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The life of money-making is one undertaken under compulsion and wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking: for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else. And so one might rather take the aforenamed objects to be ends; for they are loved for themelves.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 7</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>We do not wish to call living men happy on account of the changes that might befall them, and because we have assumed happiness to be something permanent and by no means easily changed.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 16</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Hapiness is an activity of the soul in accordance with perfect virtue.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 19</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>It makes no small difference, then, whether we form habits of one kind or of another from our very youth; it makes a very great difference, or rather, all the difference.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 24</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Virtue, then, is a state of character concerned with choice, lying in a mean, ie. the men relative to us, this being determined by reason, and by that reason by which the men of practical wisdom would determine it... virtue is a mean, with regard to what is best and right an extreme.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 31</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>We ourselves tend more naturally to pleasures, and hence are more easily carried away towards self indulgence than towards propriety.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 35</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The intermediate state is in all things to be praised, but that we must incline sometimes toward the excess, sometimes towards deficiency; for so shall we most easily hit the intermediate and what is right.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 37</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Everything that is done by reason of ignorance is not voluntary; it is only what producers pain and regret that is involuntary. For the man who has done something by reason of ignorance, and feels not the least vexation at his action, has not acted voluntarily, since he did not know what he was doing, nor yet involuntarily, since he is not pained.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 39</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Virtue also is in our own power, and so too is vice. For where it is in our power to act it is also in our power not to act.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 46</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>But if without being ignorant a man does the things which will make him unjust, he will be unjust voluntarily.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 47</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The brave man feels and acts according to the merits of the case and in whatever way reason directs.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 50</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>For it is harder to face what is painful than to abstain from what is pleasant.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 54</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Excess with regard to pleasures is self-indulgence and is culpable... but the self-indulgent man is so-called because he is pained more than he ought at not getting pleasant things.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 57</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>For the self-indulgent man, on the other hand, the particular acts are voluntary, (for he does them with craving and desire), but the whole state is less so; for no one craves to be self-indulgent.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 59</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Riches, therefore, will be used best by the man who has the virtue concerned with wealth, and this is the liberal man.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 60</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>It is no easy for the liberal man to be rich, since he is not apt either at taking or keeping, but at giving away, and does not value wealth for its own sake but as a means of giving.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 62</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Those who deserve riches most get them least.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 62</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>For it is not easy to give to all if you take from none; private persons soon exhaust their substance with giving.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 63</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The proud man, then, is an extreme in the respect of the greateness of his claims, but intermidiate in the respect of the righness of them; for he claims what is in accordance with his merits, while the others go to excess of fall short.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 68</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>It is the mark of the proud man also to ask for nothing or scarcely anything, but to give help readily.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 70</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>To conceal one's feelings, ie. to care less for truth than for what people will think, is a coward's part, and must speak and act openly; for he is free of speech because he is contemptuous.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 70</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Those who carry humour to excess are thought to be vulgar buffoons, striving after humour at all costs, and aiming rather at raising a laugh then at saying what is becoming and at avoiding pain to the object of their fun... But those who joke in a tasteful way are called ready-witted.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 77</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>We think young people should be prone to shame because they live by passion and therefore commit many errors, but are restrained by shame; and we praise young people who are prone to this passion.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 79</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>He who possesses justice can exercise his virtue not only in himself but towards another also; for many men can exercise virtue in their own affairs, but not in relation to others.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 82</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>But if a man makes gain, his action is ascribed to no form of wickedness but injustice.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 83</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The reason is that all law is universal but about some things it is not possible to make a universal statement which shall be correct.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 99</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Let it be assumed that the states by virtue of which the sould possesses truth by way of affirmations or denial are five in number: Art (knowledge of how to make things), Scientific Knowledge (demostrative knowledge of the necessary and eternal), Practical Wisdom (knowledge of how to secure the ends of human life), Philisophical Wisdom (the union of intuitive reason and science), Intuitive Reason (knowledge of the principles from which science proceeds)</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 104-107</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>It is not possible to be good in the strict sense without practical wisdom, or practically wise without moral virtue.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 117</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>So anger by reason of the warmth and hastiness of its nature though it hears, does not hear an order, and springs to take revenge.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 128</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>For not everyone who does anything for the sake of pleasure is either self-indulgent or bad or incontinent, but he who does it for a disgraceful pleasure.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 133</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The bad man is bad by virtue of pursuing the excess, not by virtue of pursuing the necessary pleasures (for all men enjoy in some way or other both dainty foods and wines and sexual intercourse, but not all men do so as they ought).</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 139</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>For without friends no one would choose to live</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 142</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Three corresponding kinds of friendship: 1) Those who love eachother because of utility, 2) Those who love eachother because of pleasure, 3) Perfect friendship is the friendship of men who are good, and alike in virtue.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 144-145</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Nature seems above all to avoid the painful and to aim at the pleasant.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 148</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>But there is another kind of friendship, namely, that which involves a inequality between the parties, e.g. that of father and son... that of man to wife and in general that of ruler to subject.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 150</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>For a man is not a king unless he is sufficient to himself and excels his subjects in all good things... therfore he will not look to his own interests but to those of his subjects.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 154</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Parents, then, love their children as themselves, while children lover their parents as being born of them, and brothers love each other as being born of the same parents.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 157</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>We should strain every nerve to avoid wickedness and should endevour to be good; for so and only so can one e either friendly to oneself or a friend to another.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 170</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The pleasure of the eye is the beginning of love.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 170</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Therefore the good man should be a lover of self (for he will be both himself profit by doing noble acts, and will benefit his fellows), but the wicked man should not; fore he will hurt both himself and his neighbours, following as he does evil passions.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 175</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>One might think that all men desire pleasure becuase they all aim at life; life is an activity, and each man is active about those things and with those faculties that he loves most.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 189</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>For amusement is a sort of relaxation, and we need relaxation because we cannot work continuously.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 193</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>It is difficult to get from youth up a right training for virtue if one has not been brought up under right laws; for to live temperately and handily is not pleasent to most people, especially when they are young.</p>
          <cite>Aristotle 2009, 199</cite>
